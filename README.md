ABSTRACT
 This paper intends to present the design of wireless charging using the Tesla 
coil. There are two methods of electrical energy transmission - 1) is wired, and 2) 
is wireless. Wired electric transmission is much complicated in design. An easy 
way to overcome this disadvantage is to use wireless transmission. This project 
explains how the electrical energy is transferred from a charging source to the 
receiver, without any wired physical connection. In this proposed work, two coils 
are used; one is primary, and another is secondary, induction principle is used, 
which creates the magnetic field. The Tesla coil can be used as a transmitter. 
This paper proposed a simple and straightforward design which does not have ac 
voltage at the input. Keywords: Tesla Coil, Transmitter, Wireless
